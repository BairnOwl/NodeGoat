A7: Access Control

This attack happens when an attacker directly inputs a URL that they should not be able to access (e.g. an admin level function). The server is vulnerable if it does not check for authorization, so I added some code to check if a user has proper authorization before being able to access a webpage.


A8: CSRF

Cross-site request forgery occurs when a user uses an attacker's website and the site sends a forged HTTP request to the victim application with the user's cookie and authentication. I prevented this attack by using the CSRF module to check for the existence of a validated token.


A9: Vulnerable Components

Using components such as libraries, modules and frameworks could be problematic if they have vulnerabilities. This could be prevented by not allowing an application to run with root privileges, amongst other cautions.

A10: Redirection

Redirection occurs when links are unvalidated and attackers can redirect users to malicious websites. It could be prevented by validating the URL, not involving user parameters, or simply avoiding redirection.
